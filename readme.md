# FINAL 25 8KCON SLOTS - (PROBABLY) ACCURATE TO Thu Feb 22 2024 22:13:28 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)
 ### Rerun every day by ROUNDERHOUSE, will get longer as more author posts are standardized.
I'll be abusing my mod powers to edit everyone's author posts but if you'd like to save me the trouble feel free. Just slap your entries into the following format in your author post; these are example values:
> [[div class="slots"]]  
> \# 8069  
> \# 8420  
> \# >80X0  
> [[/div]]  
 That last one is an example of an algorithmic choice for the lowest 80X0 value -- the > signifies the lowest, the X is the variable you can stick wherever. You can also do >80X0 for the *highest* 80X0 value. If you'd like a palindrome slot, I suggest you find god (I'm working on it).
